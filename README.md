# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A Minor Project build using the Algorithms in Machine Learning.
This Project is build using 2 Algorithms of Machine Learning: Extra Trees Regressor and Random Forest Regressor.
The dataset is taken for kaggle website.
The importance of variables by horizontal bar graph using Extra Trees Regressor.
The Best Parameters are found using RandomSearchCV (using Random Forest Regressor).
The Evaluation metrics graphs are also found using the Randon Forest Regressor.
