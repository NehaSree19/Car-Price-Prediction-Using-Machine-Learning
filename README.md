# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A Minor Project build using the Algorithms in Machine Learning.  
Programming Language is Python.  
This Project is build using 2 Algorithms of Machine Learning: Extra Trees Regressor and Random Forest Regressor.  
The Architecture of this Project is:

It is split into 6 modules:  
Module 1:Data Collection: The dataset is dowloaded from kaggle and uploaded.

Module 2: Data Preproceesing: The data is cleaned to remove any null values and missing values and split into train data(80%) and test data(20%).

Module 3: Model Building: The Machine Learning Algorithms are loaded into the model.  
Module 4: Prediction: The test data is given to this model and accuracy of the model is tested.  
Module 5: The Evaluation Metrics is checked inorder to check the working accuracy of the alogorithm given to the model.  
->Extra Trees Regressor
